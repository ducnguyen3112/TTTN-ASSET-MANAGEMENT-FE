<p>You agree that all disputes between you and Kanoo (whether or not such dispute involves a third party) with regard to your relationship with Kanoo, including without limitation disputes related to these Terms of Use, your use of the Platform, and/or rights of privacy and/or publicity, will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration under the American Arbitration Association&#39;s rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes and you and Kanoo hereby expressly waive trial by jury. As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local &quot;small claims&quot; court, if permitted by that small claims court&#39;s rules. You may bring claims only on your own behalf. Neither you nor Kanoo will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this agreement. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person&#39;s account, if Kanoo is a party to the proceeding. This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. In the event the American Arbitration Association is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of filing the case, then either Kanoo or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Platforms. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms of Use.</p>

<p>You may opt out of this agreement to arbitrate. If you do so, neither you nor Kanoo can require the other to participate in an arbitration proceeding. To opt out, you must notify Kanoo in writing within 30 days of the date that you first became subject to this arbitration provision. You must use this address to opt out:</p>

<p>Kanoo, Inc |&nbsp;(678) 685-8960&nbsp;|&nbsp;3101 Cobb Parkway Suite 124 Atlanta, GA 30339.</p>

<p>You must include your name and residence address, the email address you use for your Kanoo account, and a clear statement that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement.</p>

<p>If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration section will be null and void. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Kanoo.</p>

<h3>Time Limitation on Claims</h3>

<p>You agree that any claim you may have arising out of or related to your relationship with Kanoo must be filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, your claim is permanently barred.</p>

<h3>Governing Law &amp; Venue</h3>

<p>These Terms of Use are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Georgia, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law. If any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable during arbitration or by a court of competent jurisdiction, then that provision will be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. Kanoo&#39;s failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms will not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right. No waiver of any of these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or any other term or condition. Kanoo reserves the right to change this dispute resolution provision, but any such changes will not apply to disputes arising before the effective date of the amendment. This dispute resolution provision will survive the termination of any or all of your transactions with Kanoo.</p>

These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and Kanoo and governs your use of the Platform, superseding any prior agreements between you and Kanoo. You will not assign the Terms of Use or assign any rights or delegate any obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, without the prior written consent of Kanoo. Any purported assignment or delegation by you without the appropriate prior written consent of Kanoo will be null and void. Kanoo may assign these Terms of Use or any rights hereunder without your consent. If any provision of these Terms of Use is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable, the parties nevertheless agree that such portion will be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions, and the remaining provisions of the Terms of Use remain in full force and effect. Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice will act to modify the Terms of Use. These Terms of Use do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights.</p>

<h3>Territorial Restrictions</h3>

<p>The information provided within the Platform is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would subject Kanoo to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country. We reserve the right to limit the availability of the Platform or any portion of the Platform, to any person, geographic area, or jurisdiction, at any time and in our sole discretion, and to limit the quantities of any content, program, product, Platform or other feature that Kanoo provides.</p>
